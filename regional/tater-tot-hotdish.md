# Vegan Tater Tot Casserole

## Ingredients
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp avocado oil (or neutral oil)
- 14 oz vegan Italian sausage
- 1 cup cremini/button/portobello mushrooms, finely chopped
- 16 oz frozen veggies (e.g., green beans, carrots, corn, peas, peppers)
- 1 tsp sage or thyme
- 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour (or rice flour for gluten-free)
- 2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or any nondairy milk)
- Salt & black pepper to taste
- ~4 cups tater tots

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven**
  * Set oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Prepare Filling**
  * Heat oil in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Sauté onions and garlic with salt and pepper until soft.
  * Add vegan sausage and cook until lightly browned.
  * Stir in mushrooms and cook until softened. Add sage/thyme and flour, stirring for 2 minutes.
  * Add frozen veggies, mix well, then pour in nondairy milk. Cook until just boiling. Adjust salt and pepper.
  * **Optional: Cool**
    * Transfer the filling to a baking pan. Cover and refrigerate if preparing in advance.
    * If you take this path, the cast iron could be replaced with a non-stick skillet

3.* **Add Tater Tots**
  * Arrange frozen tater tots over the filling in a pattern, such as concentric circles.

4.* **Bake**
  * Place the skillet in the oven and bake for 55 minutes, until the tater tots are golden brown.

5.* **Serve**
  * Let the casserole rest for 5 minutes before serving.
