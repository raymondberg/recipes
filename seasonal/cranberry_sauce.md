# Orange Cranberry Sauce

## Ingredients

 * 12 oz fresh cranberries (frozen probably work)
 * 1 cup water
 * 1 cup sugar
 * 1/4 cup orange juice (could use orange liqueur instead)
 * 3 Tbsp fresh orange juice
 * 1/2 tsp Chinese Allspice
 * 1 1/2 tsp orange zest

## Directions

 * Combine everything EXCEPT the zest in a pot. Heat on medium until berries pop. This should take roughly 15 minutes.
 * Remove from heat, stir in orange zest
 * Refridgerate for at least 2 hours. Works great to prep 1-2 days in advance.

## Alternatives

* Consider anise or cloves if you don't like allspice. Use a cheescloth to
  ensure you can extract the cloves.
* Consider dropping the sugar and oj content and boiling down more if you like
  a thicker, less sweet sauce.
