# Aunt Pat's Calico Beans (15m prep, 4-8 hours cooking)

  1 pound ground beef
1/2 pound bacon diced
  1 medium onion chopped
  2 (16 ounce) cans pork and beans drained
  1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans drained and rinsed
  1 (15 ounce) can butter beans drained and rinsed (aka lima beans)
  3/4 cup brown sugar
  3/4 cup ketchup
  2 teaspoons white vinegar
  1 teaspoon Worsterchire sauce
  1 teaspoon yellow mustard
  Salt (to taste)

## Molasses Variant
I like a little molasses and pull out some ketchup + brown sugar to compensate. Experiment if you have molasses.

## Vegan Variant
Replace 1 pound ground beef with 1 pound Impossible meat (beyond meat is less ideal but fine)
Replace 1/2 pound of bacon with 1/2 pound ofeither vegan bacon or
Replace Worsterchire sauce with Pickapeppa Sauce (or other smoky/tangy vegan option)
Replace pork and beans with vegan baked beans

## Other variants

* More - Add extra beans (I love adding an extra can of kidney beans, but use your favorite..just never put black beans in mine, it pollutes the whole flavor profile)
* Smokier/spicier - Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce add a nice flavor
* Peppers - Add your favorite peppers, diced, halfway into cooking
* Garlic - Love adding some garlic powder or smash and sautee a few garlic cloves in toward the end of the meat browning


# Cooking

* Brown/sear meat in sauce-pan on medium-high to high heat (you are looking for sear, not cooking to completion, leave parts red if you want), drain and transfer meat to slow cooker.
* Turn the slow cooker on high or low
* Chop onion, size preference varies
* Add beans, onion, brown sugar, ketchup, vinegar, and mustard to slow cooker
* Mix well
* Cover and cook for 4 hours on high or 8 hours on low. About 1 hour from end check the salt levels and adjust as needed.

# Serving

Serve alongside hotdogs in place of plain baked beans, alongside other picnic salads/hotdishes or use as a dip with some hearty chips.

Or cover with a meltable cheese and eat it out of a bowl. Don't let me stop you.
